# AutomatedCommentWriter
Python script that automates comment writing to make marking faster.
A professor or TA would use this utility to speed up the marking process by automatically adding comments to a text file when a criteria is marked as incorrect.
The utility also edits student code to run tests on each in a separate Powershell window, as well as running the question generator in a new window with that specific student's questions as well.
The code is written in Python.
